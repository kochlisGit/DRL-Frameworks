# DRL-Frameworks
Comparison of different Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Frameworks. This repository includes tf-agents, acme, RLlib

# TF-Agents
TF-Agents makes designing, implementing and testing new RL algorithms easier, by providing well tested modular components that can be modified and extended. It enables fast code iteration, with good test integration and benchmarking. While not an official Tensorflow product, it's one of the most reliable, maintained and well-built frameworks based on Tensorflow for deploying reinforcement learning agents. It includes the most popular & solid reinforcement learning algorithms, as well as their extensions. More info about the agents can be found here:
